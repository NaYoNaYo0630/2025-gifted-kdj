Carnivores and herbivores are two major types of animals that differ in their feeding habits, body structures, and digestive systems. A carnivore is an animal that primarily eats the flesh of other animals. Carnivores include predators like lions, tigers, wolves, and eagles. These animals are usually well-equipped with sharp teeth, strong jaws, and claws to help them hunt,  catch, and tear apart their prey. Their digestive systems are relatively shorter and simpler because meat is rich in nutrients and easier to digest than plants. Carnivores rely heavily on protein and fat as their main sources of energy. TL;DM: 

summary : A carnivore is a carnivore that primarily eats the flesh of other

a herbivore is an animal that eats mainly plants. This includes leaves, stems, fruits, seeds, and roots. Examples of herbivores include cows, sheep, elephants, giraffes, and rabbits. Since plant material is more difficult to digest, herbivores have longer and more complex digestive systems, sometimes with multiple stomachs (like cows), or special fermentation chambers (like horses and rabbits). 
They also have flat, broad teeth that are ideal for grinding and chewing tough plant fibers. TL;DR:

summary : An herbivore may have a large or narrow stomach (like a horse's stomach) and may eat a wide variety of plants and other animal foods. 

A light bulb produces light when electricity flows through it. Most traditional light bulbs are incandescent bulbs. Inside the bulb, there is a thin metal wire called a filament, usually made of tungsten. When electricity passes through this filament, it gets very hot—so hot that it glows and gives off light. This process is called incandescence. The glass bulb around the filament is filled with an inert gas (like argon) or is vacuum-sealed. This protects the filament from reacting with oxygen and burning out quickly. TL;DR: 

summary : light blub produces light from burning filament is gives off light.

An old woman bakes a gingerbread man. When she opens the oven, he jumps out and runs away. He says, "Run, run, as fast as you can! You can’t catch me, I’m the Gingerbread Man!" He runs past a cow, a horse, and other animals. They all chase him, but he is too fast. At the river, a clever fox offers to help. The gingerbread man climbs on the fox’s back, then his nose. At the end, the fox flips him up and eats him. That’s how the gingerbread man’s adventure ends. TL;DR

summary : In the end, it was the fox who killed the fox.
